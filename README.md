# MoveImages/Videos
This script is to create month(YYYYMM) directory and move images / videos into it if they match the condition.
Please be noted that this is NOT for iOS Devices / WindowsPhone (Client).
This script is based on Powershell, so it does NOT work for Macbook (to run the code) either.

## How to use
Connect your device and enable USB debugging mode and run the code.
It works even if you connect multiple devices.(Please let me know if it does not work)

### If you did not unlock Developer mode, unlock it by following steps;

1. Go to setting > System > About Phone and tap Build number 7 times ( it may differ depending on device)
2. Go back to setting > System then go to Developer options
3. Enable the Developer options and enable USB debugging

then you only need to run this code.

* Please reboot and wait 1 mins if it does not move files as the device may store cache and would not show them properly moved.
